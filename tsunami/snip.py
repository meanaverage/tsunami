"""Message snipping — targeted removal of old messages to free tokens.

Ported from Claude Code's snipCompactIfNeeded pattern.
Unlike full compression (which summarizes everything), snipping selectively
removes the oldest, least-valuable messages while preserving structure.

Strategy:
1. Keep system prompt (index 0) and original user request (index 1)
2. Keep the last N messages (recent context)
3. Remove messages between them, starting from oldest
4. Stop when enough tokens are freed

This is faster than LLM compression and preserves more recent context.
The snipped messages are gone from the conversation (not summarized).
