"""Adversarial review — cross-examine reasoning before delivery.

After the wave writes a research synthesis or makes factual claims,
dispatch an eddy as a hostile reviewer. The eddy tries to BREAK
the argument. Its objections get fed back to the wave before delivery.

The undertow tests code. This tests reasoning.

Pattern:
1. Wave writes synthesis
2. Eddy receives: "assume this is wrong, find every error"
3. Eddy returns objections
4. Wave addresses objections or revises
5. Only then: deliver
