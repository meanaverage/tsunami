# tsunami

**an ai agent that runs on your computer. tell it what to build, it builds it.**

this fork is a personal build of the original [gobbleyourdong/tsunami](https://github.com/gobbleyourdong/tsunami), focused first on:
- macOS as the primary development target
- a hardened local setup flow
- a Docker-backed execution surface for the backend and tools

the intended runtime split in this fork is:
- host: `llama-server`, model files, Metal / GPU acceleration
- docker: Tsunami backend, tool execution, npm/dev servers, browser automation

credit to the original repo for the core agent architecture, naming, scaffolds, and project direction. this fork builds on that base rather than replacing it.

sync status:
- this fork is intended to stay close to the original repo, not diverge into a separate product
- in our view, it currently includes the upstream `main` functionality through commit `0a7a24c` ("Streaming bridge — tool calls flow to UI in real time", April 2, 2026)
- the main differences are the personal-build concerns here: mac-first testing, hardened setup/install flow, and a Docker-backed execution surface

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meanaverage/tsunami.git
cd tsunami
./setup.sh
./tsu
```

that's the default path now. setup runs from a checked-out repo, installs into `./.venv`, verifies model downloads from `models/model-manifest.lock`, and keeps shell alias changes opt-in.

`./tsu` is the app launcher. it starts the local model server if needed, starts the Tsunami backend, and opens the terminal UI.

upstream also now has a Windows-first installer path. if you are using this fork on Windows and want the PowerShell entry point, the equivalent flow is:

**Windows:**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meanaverage/tsunami/main/setup.ps1 | iex
# restart PowerShell, then:
tsunami
```

> **Windows prerequisites:** [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win), [Python 3.10+](https://python.org/downloads/), [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/), and [Visual Studio Build Tools 2019–2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) (for llama.cpp CUDA build). The installer checks for these and guides you if anything's missing.
>
> **CUDA users:** CUDA 12.x/13.x requires **Visual Studio 2019 or 2022**. VS 2026 (Preview/Insider) is not yet supported by nvcc — the installer detects this and automatically selects VS 2022 if both are present.
>
> Run the installer from a regular PowerShell terminal (not a Developer Command Prompt). The script sets up the build environment automatically.

## what it does

you type a prompt. tsunami does the rest.

- **"build me a calculator"** → writes it, tests it, verifies it renders, delivers
- **"build a 3D pinball game"** → researches Three.js patterns, builds 869 lines, tests every key binding
- **"analyze these 500 files"** → dispatches parallel workers, reads everything, synthesizes findings

no cloud. no api keys. everything runs locally on your hardware.

in this fork, the default target is a local model on the host for performance, with Tsunami's backend and tool execution able to run inside Docker when Docker is available.

## how it works

```
you → wave (9B) → understands intent, picks tools, coordinates
                     ↓
               swell dispatches parallel workers
                     ↓
         eddy 1  eddy 2  eddy 3  eddy 4  (2B workers)
                     ↓
               break collects results
                     ↓
               undertow tests the output
                     ↓
         wave reads QA report → fixes issues → delivers
```

**wave** — the brain. reasons, plans, researches, builds. (9B)
**eddies** — fast parallel workers. read, search, execute, judge. (2B)
**swell** — dispatches eddies. when agents spawn, the swell rises.
**break** — where results converge.
**undertow** — QA gate. tests what the wave built by pulling levers.

one wave coordinating 32 eddies is more capable than a single large model working alone. intelligence is the orchestration, not the weights.

---

## the tension system

tsunami doesn't just build things and hope for the best. it measures whether it's lying.

**current** — the lie detector. measures prose tension: is the agent hedging, fabricating, or grounded? returns 0.0 (truth) to 1.0 (hallucination).

**circulation** — the router. reads the current and decides: deliver, search for verification, or refuse rather than hallucinate.

**pressure** — the monitor. tracks tension over time across the session. if tension stays high, the system escalates: force a search, force a strategy change, or stop and ask for help.

**undertow** — the QA gate. after the wave builds something, the undertow pulls levers:
- takes a screenshot and asks an eddy "does this look like what was requested?"
- presses every key binding and checks if the screen changes
- reads every UI element and checks if it has content
- reports pass/fail per lever. no diagnosis. just facts.

the wave reads the QA report and figures out what's broken. the undertow keeps it simple — pull levers, report facts. the wave does the thinking. simple behaviors, emergent intelligence.

---

## research before building

tsunami searches before it codes. when asked to build something complex, it finds working examples and documentation first, then builds from real patterns instead of hallucinating API calls.

previous approach: guess at Three.js → black screen, 62% code tension
current approach: research cannon-es physics patterns → visible 3D pinball, 21% code tension

the system learns from what it finds. the prompt enforces it. the undertow catches what slips through.

## what you need

| your hardware | what you get |
|---------------|-------------|
| **4GB gpu** | lite — 2B model, basic agent |
| **12GB gpu** | full — 9B wave + eddies + image gen. everything works. |
| **32GB+ gpu** | max — 27B wave + 32 eddies + image gen. fastest. |

tsunami auto-detects your memory and configures itself. you never think about this.

the full stack is **10GB total**: 9B wave (5.3GB) + 2B eddies (1.8GB) + SD-Turbo image gen (2GB).

runs on any nvidia gpu with 12GB+ vram. macs with 16GB+ unified memory. windows, linux, and mac. no cloud required.

## setup notes

- `setup.sh` is the supported installer. it replaces the old best-effort bootstrap flow.
- the supported runtime split is:
  - host: `llama-server`, model files, GPU / Metal acceleration
  - docker: Tsunami backend, `shell_exec`, `python_exec`, npm/dev servers, browser automation
- if `docker` is present, `setup.sh` builds the local execution sandbox image.
- when the Docker path is active, the container only mounts `./workspace` from the host. the model still stays local and is reached over `http://host.docker.internal:8090`.
- if Docker is unavailable or disabled, `setup.sh` falls back to installing Playwright and Chromium on the host for browser inspection and screenshots.
- `INSTALL_SHELL_ALIAS=1 ./setup.sh` adds a `tsunami` alias to your shell rc if you want it.
- `INSTALL_PLAYWRIGHT=0 ./setup.sh` opts out of the host browser runtime install when you explicitly want a smaller non-Docker setup.
- `BUILD_DOCKER_EXEC=0 ./setup.sh` opts out of the Docker sandbox image build.
- if `node` and `npm` are present, setup installs the ink cli with `npm ci` from the tracked `cli/package-lock.json`.
- the python repl path is still the fallback when node is unavailable.

## common switches

install-time examples:

```bash
INSTALL_SHELL_ALIAS=1 ./setup.sh
```

adds a `tsunami` shell alias.

```bash
INSTALL_PLAYWRIGHT=0 ./setup.sh
```

skips the host browser runtime install. useful if you only want the lighter non-browser path.

```bash
BUILD_DOCKER_EXEC=0 ./setup.sh
```

skips building the local Docker execution image.

run-time examples:

```bash
./tsu
```

launches the app with the default auto-detected runtime.

```bash
TSUNAMI_DOCKER_BACKEND=1 ./tsu
```

forces the Docker-backed backend path.

```bash
TSUNAMI_DOCKER_BACKEND=0 TSUNAMI_DOCKER_EXEC=0 ./tsu
```

disables Docker and runs the host path only.

```bash
TSUNAMI_FORCE_SMALL_MODEL=1 ./tsu
```

forces the smaller local text model path when available.

```bash
TSUNAMI_CTX_SIZE=32768 ./tsu
```

sets the local `llama-server` context window.

```bash
TSUNAMI_LLAMA_PARALLEL=1 ./tsu
```

controls the local `llama-server` slot count / parallel request setting.

```bash
TSUNAMI_MAX_TOKENS=8000 ./tsu
```

changes the backend generation cap for model responses.

```bash
TSUNAMI_TEMPERATURE=0.2 TSUNAMI_PRESENCE_PENALTY=0.0 ./tsu
```

uses a more deterministic sampling profile, which is usually better for tool calling on local models.

```bash
TSUNAMI_TEMPERATURE=0.0 TSUNAMI_TOP_P=1.0 ./tsu
```

pushes the local model even harder toward deterministic tool selection if it is getting too creative.

```bash
TSUNAMI_DOCKER_REBUILD=0 TSUNAMI_DOCKER_BACKEND=1 ./tsu
```

reuses the existing Docker backend image instead of rebuilding it from the current tree on launch.

## docker mode

if you want the hardened path explicitly:

```bash
TSUNAMI_DOCKER_BACKEND=1 ./tsu
```

that keeps:
- the local model on the host
- the Tsunami backend in Docker
- tool execution and browser automation in Docker
- only `./workspace` shared between host and container

if you want to disable Docker entirely:

```bash
TSUNAMI_DOCKER_BACKEND=0 TSUNAMI_DOCKER_EXEC=0 ./tsu
```

## what's inside

634 tests. 43 modules. 20 rounds of adversarial security hardening.

**the wave (9B)** — reasons, plans, calls tools, dispatches eddies, synthesizes results. has vision (sees screenshots). generates images via SD-Turbo (<1 second). builds websites, writes code, does research.

**the eddies (2B)** — parallel workers with their own agent loops. each eddy can read files, run shell commands, search code. sandboxed: read-only command allowlist, no network, no file writes, no system paths. also serve as QA judges — one eddy looks at a screenshot and says whether it matches the intent.

**the swell** — dispatches eddies in parallel. the wave says "analyze these files" and the swell breaks it into tasks, sends each to an eddy, collects results. when agents spawn, the swell rises.

**the undertow** — QA lever-puller. auto-generates test levers from the HTML (every ID, every key binding, every button). pulls them all. reports what it sees. the wave reads the report and fixes what's broken.

**current / circulation / pressure** — the tension system. measures whether the agent is lying (current), routes decisions based on tension (circulation), and tracks tension trajectory over time (pressure). the lie detector, the router, and the monitor.

**context management** — three-tier compaction (fast prune → message snipping → LLM summary). large tool results saved to disk with previews in context. auto-compact circuit breaker. file-type-aware token estimation.

**security** — 12 bash injection checks. destructive command detection. eddy sandbox with command allowlist (not blocklist — learned that lesson after the eddies deleted the codebase twice during testing). self-preservation rules. path traversal prevention. env var protection.

## upgrade the wave

the installer gives you everything. if you want a bigger brain later:

```bash
# 27B wave (32GB+ systems)
huggingface-cli download unsloth/Qwen3.5-27B-GGUF Qwen3.5-27B-Q8_0.gguf --local-dir models
```

```powershell
# Windows — 27B wave (32GB+ systems)
huggingface-cli download unsloth/Qwen3.5-27B-GGUF Qwen3.5-27B-Q8_0.gguf --local-dir models
```

tsunami auto-detects and uses the biggest model available.

## contributing

this codebase is under heavy active development. multiple files change per day. PRs against core files (`agent.py`, `prompt.py`, `tools/`, `undertow.py`) will likely conflict within hours.

**best approach:**
1. open an issue first to discuss what you want to change
2. target isolated new files (new scaffolds, new tools, new tests) that don't overlap with the core
3. keep PRs small and focused — one feature per PR
4. expect rebases — the main branch moves fast

we read every PR and incorporate good ideas even if we can't merge directly. your contribution shapes the direction.

## origin

this repository is a fork of the original [gobbleyourdong/tsunami](https://github.com/gobbleyourdong/tsunami).

the original project established the core Tsunami ideas:
- the wave / eddy / swell / undertow model
- the local-first autonomous agent direction
- the scaffolded build workflow

this fork adds and emphasizes:
- a hardened checked-out-repo installer
- pinned dependency and model-manifest flows
- mac-first runtime testing
- a Docker-backed execution surface while keeping the local model on the host

the goal is to remain broadly in sync with upstream capabilities while carrying those local operational choices on top.

tsunami itself was built from the distilled patterns of agents that came before — the ones that worked, the ones that failed, and the lessons they left behind.

the standing wave propagates.
